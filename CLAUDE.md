## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as local markdown files under `.scratch/<feature>/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-role vocabulary (needs-triage, needs-info, ready-for-agent, ready-for-human, wontfix), recorded as a `Status:` line in each issue file. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Grilling (/grill-with-docs)

Ask one question at a time, then STOP and wait for the user's answer. Don't answer your own questions, don't generate the next round ahead of the answer, and don't begin implementation without the user's explicit permission.
